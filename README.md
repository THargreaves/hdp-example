# Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes Example

This repository provides an example application of Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes to topic modelling. Specifically, we find common topics in the abstracts of papers pubished by members of the Cambridge Machine Learning Group.

An example output of the model can be viewed [here](https://thargreaves.github.io/hdp-example/index.html).

## Requirements

You will need an installation of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).

## Usage

Run `sudo docker-compose up` from the root directory of the repository and navigate to the server link from the console.
